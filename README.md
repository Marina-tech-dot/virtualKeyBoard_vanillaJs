# virtualKeyBoard_vanillaJs

This project is written in vanilla JS. 
It implements the basic concepts I learned:
- it is built on classes by a simple framework type;
- there are two classes components, in which the event listener is implemented;
- an emitter is implemented which allows different components to subscribe to each other;
- state allows you to save all of the input data;
- it has a small jquery-style self-written library to simplify the use of the same kind of functions.


Technical functionality
- introduction of typed characters and untyped functions by clicking on the virtual keys;
- implementation of non-printing characters: Tab, Backspace, Enter, Shift, CapsLock, right-left arrows;
- language switching en / ru on virtual keyboard;
- keyboard sound;
- connection of the speech recognition API;
- saving all the entered values into the LocalStorage
- adaptation to a screen width from 500px;
- integrate physical keyboard, highlight on the virtual keyboard keys pressed on the physical keyboard;
- ability to expand the monitor to full screen width and continue working with the physical keyboard. After reducing the size of the monitor and return to work with the virtual keyboard and do not lose focus.
